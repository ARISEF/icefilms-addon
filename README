#All code Copyleft (GNU GPL v2) Anarchintosh and icefilms-xbmc teama

Addon also requires: 
script.module.simplejson-2.0.10.zip
script.module.elementtree-1.2.7.zip
This should be installed automatically when stable release is installed from googlecode repository.
You can also get them from http://code.google.com/p/anarchintosh-projects/downloads/list

Megaroutines is scheduled to be replaced with videourlresolver module, when it is stable.
For *most* sources this will enable support for lower quality streaming from megavid, which is useful for netbook users and lower bandwidth consumption.

After v1.1.0, iceilms addon is scheduled to be replaced by videofalcon
https://github.com/icefilms-xbmc/videofalcon

All that really needs completing for v1.1.0 is the metacontainer code, the building + uploading of the metacontainers and the bugsquashing of the addon.
