Addon also requires: 
script.module.simplejson-2.0.10.zip
script.module.mechanize
These should be installed automatically when stable release is installed from googlecode repository.
You can also get them from http://code.google.com/p/anarchintosh-projects/downloads/list

to test the dev versions, get the first metadata container from: 
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=PNE0TNPF

unzip it and put meta_caches in the userdata/addons/plugin.video.icefilms folder.

This repo should only ever contain stable versions of the megaroutines script.
Use the link below for megaroutines dev:
https://github.com/icefilms-xbmc/megaroutines


v1.0.0 has been finalised, but there is the weird error that is produced after the meta containers are installed.
error is possibly due to file permissions?
