Addon also requires: 
script.module.simplejson-2.0.10.zip
script.module.mechanize
These should be installed automatically when stable release is installed from googlecode repository.
You can also get them from http://code.google.com/p/anarchintosh-projects/downloads/list

v1.0.0 has been finalised. Metacontainers and metacontainer handlers have been fully updated and tested.
It will now self-install the metacontainers when first run.
